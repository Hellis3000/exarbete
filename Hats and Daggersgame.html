                            In a world much like our own but with a big difference. The paranormal is real and its full of 
                            terrible secrets and dangerous mysteries. Enter the Department for Appraisal and Protection against the Paranormal, Extradimensional and Reanimated.
                            A organization that is tasked with safegaurding mankind from the terrors of the cosmic and other worldending horros. You play as one of the agents of 
                            this organization as you

                            Rather fitting to the narrative, Hats and Daggers uses Powered by the Apocalypse where you always progress the story somehow,
                            even if you fail a roll. Using sixsided dice, you roll two dice to see where you land on
                            a scale between 2 and 12. Depending on what you roll, you either succed, partially succeed
                            or fail (at a six or less). But even if you fail, the story doesnt stop. Your situation
                            merely becomes more complicated or escelate.

                            In Hats and Daggers, your resources are often limited and your goals cannot always be reached simply by blasting a hole in a zombie or vampire. Every playbook has 
                            their own unique ways to

                            As a member of Hats and Daggers, your exposed to any number of strnage sects, apocalytic cults, ancient Conspiracies and mysterious forces

                            Robots and Duels have a twofold progression track, in that you not only
                            grow as a individual, but also a a group. As part of a Duelists Association,
                            you climb the ranks as your bring prestige to your Association. Prestige can be lost
                            as well as won, so unlike your personal progression which lets you master more techniques
                            and weapon skills, your Prestige is something you need to keep in mind when you act!

                            Play either as a Hat aka the investigative, academic or diplimatic types. Or as the Dagger, who provide
                            security, hunt beasts and otherwise get int othe nitty gritty. Both type of playbook is often needed and each playbook, 
                            from the Monster Hunter to the Schoolar, are made in such a way that they can bring their own twist to things.

                            In hats and daggers, there is threats bouth without and from within. Any suffeciently big organization can be infiltrated, and Dapper is not different.
                            Be it within the organization or outside of it, whne you progress the story and  interact with the world, a conspiracy "clock" ticks forwards, progressing
                            the story behind the scenes, giving the Narrator or GM a new set of tools to test the players with.
