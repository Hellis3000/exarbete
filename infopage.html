                    <h2>RPG: Short for Roleplaying Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        RPG is a acronym, short for Roleplaying Game. Chances are you heard of them before. Either as a
                        genre of videogames, or maybe you heard about Dungeon and Dragons.
                        A roleplaying game is a form of collaborative storytelling and game that generally is run by
                        throwing dice to determine certein outcomes within the narrative. Some
                        games use other engines of chance, such as a deck of cards rather then dice. But dice are by far
                        the most common.

                        The charm and appeal of a roleplaying game lies in the fact that anyone with a smidge of imagination
                        can play it. All you need is a couple of friends, some dice and whatever basic ruleset is needed to 
                        understand the game. Depending on the game, the complexity of the game varies. Some are very rules light,
                        others are heavy on the rules. Some emphesize combat, and making the player feel like a badass. Others 
                        focus on charachter development and social interactions. There is a myriad of games out there. All with 
                        their own sping on things.
