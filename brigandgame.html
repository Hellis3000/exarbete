                            Brigand galaxy uses Powered by the Apocalypse where you always progress the story somehow,
                            even if you fail a roll. Using sixsided dice, you roll two dice to see where you land on
                            a scale between 2 and 12. Depending on what you roll, you either succed, partially succeed
                            or fail (at a six or less). But even if you fail, the story doesnt stop. Your situation
                            merely becomes more complicated or escelate. </p>
